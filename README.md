# Anomaly-Detection
An Anomaly is something that deviates from what is normal or expected. <br>
Application :- Bank frauds :  In credit card transactions, most of the fraudulent cases deviate from the behavior of a normal transaction. It's subjective to say what normal transaction behavior is but there are different types of anomaly detection techniques to find this behavior. <br>
Machine learning models used : <br>
1)K-nearest neighbors (KNN) <br>
2)Histogram-based outlier (HBOS)
3) Local outlier factor(LOF)
   a)Outlier Detection 
   b)Novelty Detection
4)Connectivity-based Outlier Factor(COF)
