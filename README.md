# Anomaly-Detection
**An Anomaly is something that deviates from what is normal or expected.** <br>
**Application** :- Bank frauds :  In credit card transactions, most of the fraudulent cases deviate from the behavior of a normal transaction. It's subjective to say what normal transaction behavior is but there are different types of anomaly detection techniques to find this behavior. <br>
**Machine learning models used** : <br>
1) *K-nearest neighbors (KNN) <br>
2)*Histogram-based outlier (HBOS) <br>
3) *Local outlier factor(LOF) <br>
   a)*Outlier Detection <br>
   b)*Novelty Detection <br>
4)*Connectivity-based Outlier Factor(COF) <br>
